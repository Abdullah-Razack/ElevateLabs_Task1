Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

A comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing workflow was executed on the marketing_campaign.csv dataset.
Python, utilizing the Pandas library, was employed to address various data quality issues.
Specific actions undertaken included standardizing column names, imputing missing values in the 'income' attribute, eliminating duplicate records, ensuring consistent datetime formats for relevant fields, deriving an 'age' metric from 'year_birth' data, and normalizing categorical text entries.
